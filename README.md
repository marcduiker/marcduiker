I've started a series of lessons for people new to serverless on Azure. Every other week we do a live coding session to go through [the lessons which are all open source](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university).

### 🤖 - Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot

I've built the *Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot* ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/az_func_updates), [GitHub](https://github.com/marcduiker/az-func-updates)). It's been tweeting about new releases related to dozens of Azure Functions GitHub repositories since early 2019.

There are plans for extending this bot, see the [issues](https://github.com/marcduiker/az-func-updates/issues).

### 🕹 - Azure Functions, The Game

*Azure Functions, The Game*, is a retro game made with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). It can be played online [here](https://marcduiker.itch.io/azure-functions-the-game). Sourcecode is in this [repo](https://github.com/marcduiker/pico-8-games).
